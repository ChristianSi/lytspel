## Bugs and Improvements

The full [source code](https://github.com/ChristianSi/lytspel) of the
Lytspel converter and this website can be found on GitHub. This includes
all needed data files, such as a [comprehensive
dictionary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChristianSi/lytspel/master/data/lytspel-dict.csv)
(CSV file) with more than 100,000 entries.

You have an idea for how the converter could be improved? You have noticed
words that are missing from the Lytspel dictionary and could be added? You
have spotted words in the Lytspel dictionary whose reformed spelling is
clearly based on a mispronunciation? Something else doesn't work or could
be improved?

In all these and similar cases, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/ChristianSi/lytspel/issues) on GitHub. Note that
issues there are public, hence anyone can read them. If you find that too
complicated or cumbersome or if you prefer to keep things private, send me
a (preferably encrypted) email instead.
