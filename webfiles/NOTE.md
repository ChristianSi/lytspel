This directory contains the source code of the website's favicon as well as
the content of several pages shown by the web app. The icon was designed in
LibreOffice; exported as png, size: 600x600 px; uploaded to
https://realfavicongenerator.net/ (using a svg instead of png didn't work
correctly with that website).

Options used on realfavicongenerator.net:

* iOS: set background color to #ffffff (white)
* Windows Metro: use white silhouette on dark purple (#603cba)
* Generator options: path: /static
