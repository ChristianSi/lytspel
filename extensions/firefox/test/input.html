    <h1>Lytspel, a Simple Phonetic Respelling for the English Language</h1>

    <p>
    The <strong>North Wind</strong> and the <strong>Sun</strong> were disputing
    which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak.
    They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his
    cloak off should be considered <em>stronger than the other.</em> Then the
    North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely
    did the traveler fold his cloak around him; and at last the North Wind gave
    up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler
    took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the
    Sun was the stronger of the two.

    <p>That quick beige fox jumped in the air over each thin dog under a calm
    autumn moon. “Look out,” I shout, “for he’s foiled you yet again, creating
    chaos.”</p>
