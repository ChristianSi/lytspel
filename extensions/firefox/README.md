# Lytspel

**Lytspel is a simple phonetic respelling for the English language.**


## What it does

Lytspel is a proposal for reforming the English spelling in order to make
it strictly follow the alphabetic principle. The alphabetic principle means
that there is a predictable relationship between written letters and spoken
sounds. When you see a written word, you know how to pronounce it (even if
you don't know the word itself), and vice versa.

This extension converts webpages written in English into the Lytspel
spelling. It can be turned on or off by the click of a button.

The extension also allows converting local files into Lytspel. Currently,
HTML, epub, and txt (plain text) files are supported. A copy of the
original is preserved with the extension ".orig" appended to its name.
